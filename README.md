# Classification of encrypted traffic using deep learning
This repository contains the code used and developed during a master thesis at DTU Compute in 2018.  
Professor [Ole Winther](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/) has been supervisor for this master thesis.  
Alex Om√∏ Agerholm from [Napatech](https://www.napatech.com/) has been co-supervisor for this project.

In this thesis we examined and evaluated different ways of classifying encrypted network traffic by use of neural networks. For this purpose we created a dataset with a streaming/non-streaming focus. The dataset comprises seven different classes, five streaming and two non-streaming.
The thesis serves as a preliminary proof-of-concept for Napatech A/S. 

We propose a novel approach where the unencrypted parts of network traffic, namely the headers are utilized. This is done by concatenating the initial headers from a session thus forming a signature datapoint as shown in the following figure:

The datasets created by use of the first 8 and 16 headers are available in the datasets folder in this repository.
We explored the dataset by running t-SNE on the concatenated headers dataset. As can be seen in the t-SNE plot below, which shows all the individual datasets merged, it seems possible to perform classification of individual classes.

In experiments using the header-based approach we achieve very promising results, showing that a simple neural network with a single hidden layer of less than 50 units, can predict the individual classes with an accuracy of 96.4\% and an AUC of 0.99 to 1.00 for the individual classes, as shown in the following figures.

The thesis hereby provides a solution to network traffic classification using the unencrypted headers.
